# QUICK SORT
# - choose any element as pivot
# - do 'partition': elements that are less than the pivot should be placed on the left side, while elements greater than the pivot should be placed on the right side
# - choose pivot element in the left side
# - do 'partition' again until all elements are sorted
# - choose pivot element in the right side
# - do 'partition' again until all elements are sorted

# unsorted list of numbers
